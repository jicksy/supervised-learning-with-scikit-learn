# supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn
This was done as part of datacamp course : https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn

This course gave me a solid confidence to apply Machine Learning to datasets. All the .ipynb files uploaded in my git are 'ready to run'. I am uploading these for my reference. These exercises may not make much sense to you unless you take the above mentioned datacamp course. 

Modules are in following order

#### 1. classification

#### 2. regression

#### 3. fine_tuning_your_model

#### 4. preprocessing_and_pipeline
