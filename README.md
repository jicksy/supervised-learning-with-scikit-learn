# supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn
This was done as part of datacamp course : https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn

This course gave me a solid confidence to apply Machine Learning to datasets. All the .ipynb files uploaded in my git are 'ready to run'. I am uploading these for my reference. These exercises may not make much sense to you unless you take the above mentioned datacamp course. 

Modules are in following order

#### 1. classification
       * Supervised Learning, Exploratory Data Analysis, k- Nearest Neighbors, Measuring Model Performance, Train Test Split, Fit Predict Accuracy, Overfitting and underfitting

#### 2. regression
       * The basics of linear regression, Cross - Validation, K- fold CV comparison, Regularized regression, Lasso, Ridge

#### 3. fine_tuning_your_model
       * Logistic Regression and LOC curve, Precision-Recall curve, Area Under the ROC curve, AUC computation, Hyperparameter tuning, GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV, Hold-out set 

#### 4. preprocessing_and_pipeline
       * Preprocessing data, creating dummy variables, regression with categorical features, handling missing data, imputing missing data in ML pipeline, centering and scaling, pipeline for classification, pipeline for regression
